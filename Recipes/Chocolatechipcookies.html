    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A classic feel good dessert. Crispy edges, and a soft chewy center.</p>
   
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon sea salt</li>
      <li>8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
      <li>2 cups packed light brown sugar</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
   
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
      <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
      <li>In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or in a large bowl with a handheld electric mixer), beat the butter and sugar on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the eggs and beat until blended. Add the vanilla and beat until blended.</li>
      <li>Turn the mixer off and add the flour mixture to the bowl. Mix on medium just until the flour is mixed in, then turn the mixer to high speed for a few seconds to pull the dough together;it will be chunky.</li>
      <li>Add the chocolate chips and beat on high for about 5 seconds to thoroughly and quickly mix in the chips.</li>
      <li>Drop by large spoonfuls on the lined baking sheet; don't flatten them. Bake until lightly browned on top, 10 to 11 minutes. Cool on the pan on a rack for 1 minute, then transfer the cookies to the rack to cool completely. Repeat with the remaining dough.</li>
      <li>Store the cookies in a tightly covered container at room temperature for up to 3 days.</li>
    </ol>
    <em>Makes about 40 cookies</em>
