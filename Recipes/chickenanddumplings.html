      <h2>Description</h2> 
      <p>When the days get shorter and colder, you crave something to lift your spirits. These easy to make Chicken and Dumplings fill that need and your fridge making plenty of leftovers for the next day. They are easy to prepare and ready in under an hour! </p>
      
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Three 32-ounce cans chicken broth</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
        <li>Two 16.3-ounce cans refrigerated Pillsbury Grands! Southern Homestyle Original biscuits</li>
        <li>1 cup half and half </li>
        <li>4 cups shredded meat from 1 store bought rotisserie chicken</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black pepper, or to taste</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>In a large (6 to 7-quart) soup pot, bring broth to boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to simmer.</li>
        <li>Dust a cutting board with some of the flour. Remove the bisquits from the cans and seperate them. Place the biscuits on the floured board and cut each one in thirds in one direction and then in thirds at a 90-degree angle to the first cut, to make 9 peices. As you cut a few biscuits, scrape the pieces and the flour into the simmering broth. Continue to generously flour the board as you cut.</li>
        <li>Stir in the half-and half, shredded chicken, and salt and pepper. Cover and simmer gently until heated through and the dumplings are cooked, about 20 minutes. Ladle into bowls and serve hot.</li>
      <li>Store leftovers in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop.</li>
     </ol>
